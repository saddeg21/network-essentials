In MAC and LINUX -> Berkeley Sockets (also called POSIX or UNIX sockets)
In WINDOWS -> WINSOCK is being used

## WINSOCK ##
Winsock expects you to initialize it before use it and also requires a cleanup function. These are not used in Berkeley sockets.

## UDP vs TCP ##
UDP is connectionless and is being used in DNS.
TCP doesnt work with broadcast or multicast

## TCP PROGRAM FLOW ##
getaddrinfo() is being used to get the ip address of website via using domain name
struct addrinfo is being used to store it.

Then socket() being created and bind() is being called to make socket bounded to the
listening specific port and IP

then listen() being called. Now it is listening for request

The server can then call accept(), which will wait until a request is being made. If
there is a request being made, then new socket being created and old one stays alive,too

New socket handles two thing.
send() -> used to send data
recv() -> used to get data from client

Old socket is still listening for new request

## UDP PROGRAM FLOW ##
UDP client must know address of server to send first request. Then getaddrinfo() is
being called.

After socket is being created client can use sendto() and recvfrom()
It is different from TCP because there is no handshake, but client must use sendto()
function.
