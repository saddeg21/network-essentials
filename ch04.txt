## UDP CLIENT FUNCTIONS

sendto() instead of send() and connect()
connect() in UDP only stores an address locally so it makes a socket associated with a
remote address

We can either use connect(), send() and recv() or sendto() and recvfrom()

When we use connect(), we return data from basically a local address. When using recvfrom() it returns any incoming data from any peer
Unless we call bind(), our local address and port is assigned automatically by OS
